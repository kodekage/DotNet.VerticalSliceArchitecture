## Vertical Slice Architecture

This is an experimental project to demonstrate the use of the vertical slice architecture in building a fully fledged
a fictional API for an Electronic Commerce solution.

The API should allow users to create, read, update,
and delete (CRUD) products, categorize them, and place orders. It will include user authentication and authorization
using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to ensure that only authenticated users can create or update resources, while anyone can
view products and categories.The API should allow users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) products, categorize
